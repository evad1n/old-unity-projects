Project Humans Versus Zombies


Description
In this project we created a simulation similar to the game Humans versus Zombies. We used steering forces and vehicle
behaviors to create a dynamic environment with obstacles and boundaries.


User Responsibilities
The user can use the GUI buttons to toggle debug view, spawn a human, switch camera views and restart the level.


Above and Beyond

Themed to be aquatic

All models/animations made by me in Maya.

Made the park 3D instead of on a plane (Made it look like a fish tank) and changed all code to correspond with a 3D environment.

Added ambient music.

Multiple camera modes for following humans and zombies.

Restart/Quit functionality.

Added death particles for humans.

Added some stuff to make it more realistic:
-Wander speed is slower than evasion/pursuit so there appears to be some haste
-Humans are quicker and more nimble than zombies


Known Issues
The avoid obstacle method was giving me trouble in 2D and in 3D it wasn't working very well so I decided to just use the separate
behavior but for the obstacles (fleeing from an obstacle when it is too close). Although it isn't "avoiding" it makes more sense as 
my obstacles are mines so you'd want to run away from them.
