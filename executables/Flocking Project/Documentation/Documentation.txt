Project Flocking


Description
In this project we created a 3D environment with vehicles that exhibited flocking characteristics such as alignment, 
cohesion, and separation.


User Responsibilities
The user can use the "C" key to switch camera views and use the up and down arrows to change flock distance.


Above and Beyond

Change flock distance

Dynamic flocking


Known Issues
The debug lines and centers for each flock are drawn for every flocker and its local flock due to dynamic flocking
