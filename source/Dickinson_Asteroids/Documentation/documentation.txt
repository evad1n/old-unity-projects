Project Asteroids


Description
In this project we recreated the classic Asteroids game (http://www.freeasteroids.org/) in Unity from scratch.


User Responsibilities
The user can used either the WASD or arrow keys to control their ship. The up arrow or W key accelerates the vehicle and the arrow keys (A and D) rotate the vehicle. 
The space bar is used to shoot bullets and the down arrow or S key activates Marinara Madness (a power up). The user must destroy as many asteroids as possible. The user only has 3 lives which will be depleted
upon contact with an asteroid.


Above and Beyond

Ship invulnerability (blinking and green) when destroyed

Added third level asteroids (100 points for destruction)

Italian themed assets and such

Restart/Quit functionality

Added music and sound effects for asteroid destruction

Added particle effects for asteroid destruction

Added power up MARINARA MADNESS that shoots tomato sauce like a flamethrower (with power up bar)




Known Issues
There are error messages that appear that most likely have something

Notes
I am using the grace period for this project
